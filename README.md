# Amusement-Park-Themed-Marble-Track
## A marble track designed for kids

Our project is a marble track designed for kids. It is a closed-loop game where the ball starts at the reservoir or any other starting point and goes through several stages, including:


1. Elevator: The ball is lifted and guided by an elevator system.
2. Shooting: The ball is launched from a shooting mechanism.
3. Sorting: A ball sorting mechanism, equipped with sensors and actuators, automatically sorts the balls into three different tracks based on their colors.
4. Pathways: The sorted balls travel through various pathways.


The sorted balls are then collected and fed back into the elevator system, which lifts and guides them into the shooting mechanism again. The loop continues in this manner.
